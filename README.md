helps increase focus, stops procrastination, get results, drives you to keep going

treat your time with respect

Close the deal by - ‘Im running out of time I have something I have next’ - set the next agenda.

Good meetings - select correct invitees, goals/objectives, agenda, keep control, decisions must be made, minutes/ROD

Don’t waste other people’s time.


Task management

Process managing tasks during its lifecycle including planning tracking and reporting

Capture, organise and do

Capture tasks ambiguously:

You could delegate? But this is delegated anyway.

Agenda - appointment, schedules.

Two minute rule?

Time your agenda.

Time and task management have to go together

Momentem, rescue time dash can be used for time management

Prioritising tasks

Label your items in the list to either urgent or important

Capture => put in list => priorities tasks
